# Emergency Calls Dispatcher

## In brief

Currently, all emergency calls go through a call center in the bid order. Calls are then taken one by one depending on the resources (operators) available. Unfortunately, emergencies are not always of equivalent priorities and the resources often lose time on cases considered less important, putting on hold cases considered more important. The idea is to develop an application that will respond simultaneously all calls received at the central to quickly analyze the content and context of the conversation, and then redirect those calls to available resources with targeted expertise.
